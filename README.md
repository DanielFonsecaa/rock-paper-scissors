# rock-paper-scissors
a rock paper scissor game with html, css and js


Having only two weeks left of my bootcamp is over, they passed us one exercice that we were suppose to make a simple rock paper scissor game.
We were given just the css. We have to implement correctly the css to the html and create a file with the logic in java script.
